# ResuBI

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop a Python-based solution that automates the extraction of resume attachments from an HR's email account. The project should utilize prompt engineering techniques to standardize and convert all resumes into a unified format. The final output should be a Power BI dashboard presenting the resumes in a visually appealing and easily accessible manner, streamlining the HR's resume review process.

### STEPS to FOLLOW:
1. Install all the required libraries or dependancies with pip install in your command prompt 
2. Update your Gmail ID crefentials in credentials.py
3. Make an openai key and put the key in resume.py
4. Update the SQL Server credentials in resume.py
5. Make a new folder docs where all these files are placed and update the folder path on main.py
6. Run the main.py file

Resume.pbix is a pwerBi file where you can see all the results. Just connect that file with your SQL server and refresh it.
